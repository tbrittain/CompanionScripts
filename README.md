# Companion Scripts

> SQL scripts for exploring SMB Explorer Companion data

This repository contains SQL scripts for use with the application database
for [SMB Explorer Companion](https://github.com/tbrittain/SmbExplorerCompanion).
Some of these may represent features that I want to add to the app, while others are just for exploring the data.

The majority of these queries were designed to work with a single franchise within the app. If you have multiple,
you may need to add an additional filter based on the `Franchise`.`Id`.
